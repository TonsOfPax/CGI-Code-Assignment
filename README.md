# CGI-Code-Assignment
Ceiling Fan Java assignment as requested by CGI for review.

Program utilizes a controlling class Main.java to simulate using a ceiling fan from CeilingFan.java. Compile all .java files and run Main.

Assignment Description:

Fan Exercise Problem Statement:

Using Core Java, Implement a simple ceiling fan with these characteristics:

·         The unit has 2 pull cords:

o   One increases the speed each time it is pulled.  There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting. 

§  If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting.

o   One reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting.

§  Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.

·         You can assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch)
